# M1 Data Mining Project
Code for Data Mining Project March 2020

Dataset: Mice Protein Expression Data Set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mice+Protein+Expression
Aim to analyse the dataset and try to identify interesting features using various R packages and also:
1. Dealing with missing values and categorical variables.
2. Building various models with 10 fold cross validation (Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Neural networks and Naives bayes).
3. Building another model after performing PCA.
4. Studying the behaviour of the model and final analysis on performance of the models with high dimensional dataset.
